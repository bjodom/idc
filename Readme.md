## Overview<div id='overview'/>

The Intel Developer Cloud (IDC) trial is open to pre-qualified Intel customers, approved developers, and all Intel employees.  While we plan to formerly launch in the future, today you will already be gaining access to a powerful, highly functional, system, and one that can greatly benefit from you sharing your experiences so we can improve it.  In other words, it is not perfect and we would appreciate your help finding the rough edges.

The picture below illustrates how to think of this system at a high level.

This is NOT a cluster, and it is not a system which will give you root access.  The system is a shared system (please be respectful of others in not hogging resources unnecessarily), not a virtualized one.

This IS a system with round-the-clock access to systems with 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors and Intel GPU Max series GPUs (PVCs).

![High level view](https://github.com/jamesreinders/idc/assets/6556265/1a7a1392-1e0e-44d1-825f-b99d4ccb8458)

--- 
## Simple 1-2-3 steps <div id='steps'/>

This Readme files has a lot of detail, but you should start by focusing on only three things:

1. Get an account on Intel® Developer Zone.  If you have one, you do not need to create a new one.  If you need one, <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/secure/forms/developer/standard-registration.html?tgt=www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/secure/developer/devcloud/cloud-launchpad.html">sign up now</a> - it is free and instant.  Note: Intel employees also have an employee login option that is only usable internally (in the office, or externally via VPN) - just look for the "Employee Sign In" and click that instead of entering a username, etc.  If you are an Intel employee, you can create an account with any non-Intel email in order to sign in without being on the corporate network.
2. Have an Public-Private Authentication Key Pair that has ed25519 or RSA 4096 level of strength.  If you have one, you do not need to create a new one.  If you need one, follow [SSH Setup](#ssh-setup) instructions to create one (free and instant).  With your key, we recommend setting up your config file to make ssh easy (see [SSH .config Client Setup](#ssh-config-client-setup)).
3. Create and use the service - it is free and instant (no need to enter any payment information - no credit card needed). Everyone can schedule and deploy the service with <a href="https://scheduler.cloud.intel.com/">Intel® Developer Cloud management console.</a>  From there pick `Intel® Max Series GPU (PVC) on 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® processors - 1100 series (4x) (Batch Processing/Scheduled access)`.  Intel employees wanting to use their employee login, should get on the internal network (VPN) and go <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/devcloud/services.html">here</a> and click <a href="https://scheduler.cloud.intel.com/">Sign In</a>. 

These three steps will get you ON the system.  You'll find more instructions on setting up an environment, using Jupyter, and more later in this Readme.

---  
## Account Registration<div id='sign-up'/>

Here the process to get your account and access the service, described above, step-by-step.

To access the batch service, external users must register for an Intel® Developer Cloud user account, via the Sign Up button on the Intel® Developer Cloud landing page (http://cloud.intel.com) and follow the steps in the Intel Cloud registration process.
Intel employees can use their existing intel.com credentials to access the Intel® Developer Cloud portal and select the batch service via the "Employee Sign In" link on this same page.

<div id='put-key-in'/>
Next, we proceed to https://scheduler.cloud.intel.com/#/systems to go to the cloud management console.

Here we need to make sure our SSH public key is in our profile.  Click the person/profile icon on the blue bar (NOT the one higher up on the same page).

![image](https://github.com/jamesreinders/idc/assets/6556265/0a42c806-a477-4364-a662-2fadc1e8b14e)

Paste in your public key

![image](https://github.com/jamesreinders/idc/assets/6556265/2add9951-5b84-4c57-99cd-046bf3ab0a37)

Click "Save Key" and then Select the "Instances" Tab.

![image](https://github.com/jamesreinders/idc/assets/6556265/c47ac23c-f762-4ab2-96f3-4f091981252e)

Check the "Scheduled..." instance, and click "Launch Instance"

![image](https://github.com/jamesreinders/idc/assets/6556265/d1e99388-ae61-4a04-988f-d56b8a6fb710)

Request access by clicking "Request Access."  Note: once you have an instance, this page would show you the information (username, etc.) in case you have forgotten it.

![image](https://github.com/jamesreinders/idc/assets/6556265/ed10f222-0ce9-4140-b4f1-2fa8e327924b)

Enter your organization/affiliation/company and an explanation.  Once your explanation is 35 characters long, you can click "Request Access" and you will be granted access immediately.

![image](https://github.com/jamesreinders/idc/assets/6556265/7ea81251-ca28-4f82-96a8-a6edc5732e8d)

Make note of you user ID, you will need it.

![image](https://github.com/jamesreinders/idc/assets/6556265/b924f350-d486-44d3-9e5d-45350e3c153c)

This is a good time to follow the [SSH .config Client Setup](#ssh-config-client-setup) instructions using your new user ID information.

Please, please, please be sure your .ssh file permissions are set correctly.  Failure to do so, is the NUMBER ONE REASON for FAILURE to be able to ssh to the instance.

Now you can ssh to the node.   "ssh myidc" (use the name you set in your ~/.ssh/config).

From here, the most likely thing you want to do is `srun --pty bash` to open a live session on a 4th Gen Xeon system with Intel Max GPUs (PVCs) - where you can compile and run code (including single node multi-rank MPI programs), launch Jupyter notebooks, and more!

---
## SSH Setup<div id='ssh-setup'/>

### ssh-keygen

ssh-keygen is a tool for creating new authentication key pairs for SSH. Such key pairs are used for automating logins, single sign-on, and for authenticating hosts.  The IDC uses SSH Keys exclusively and you will never use a password for authentication.

### SSH Public Key Creation

To create a key use the `ssh-keygen` utility found in your terminal application.  Windows powershell, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) Terminal, Linux or MAC Terminal

For WSL, Linux and MAC clients enter the below command
```bash
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_idc -C "your@email.com"
```
For PowerShell enter:
```bash
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f C:\Users\YourID\.ssh\id_ed25519_idc
```

The passphrase is optional and you can hit enter for no pass phrase.  This will result in two files being generated: `id_ed25519_idc` and `id_ed25519_idc.pub` take care of these files as they are the private and public key pair that will be tied to your IDC account.

### SSH .config Client Setup (assumes no proxy needed)<div id='ssh-config-client-setup'>

To make accessing the IDC convenient, it is recommended to setup a `.ssh\config` file.

### Linux, WSL, & MAC clients

```bash
Host myidc #←YOU CAN CALL IT ANYTHING
Hostname idcbetabatch.eglb.intel.com
User uXXXXXX #← Request "scheduled access" at https://scheduler.cloud.intel.com/#/systems" to get your user identifier.
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_idc
#ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -x YourProxy:XXXX %h %p # Uncomment if necessary
ServerAliveInterval 60
ServerAliveCountMax 10
StrictHostKeyChecking no # Frequent changes in the setup are taking place now, this will help reduce the known hosts errors.
UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
```
### For Intel Employees - you need PROXY settings to function from VPN or in the office

Visit <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mw72yskf">Internal Wiki</a> for a run down of settings, which may differ based on your location.

### For MingW64 users use below, line order matters.<div id='mingw64'>

```bash
#ProxyCommand "C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\bin\connect.exe" -S proxy-dmz.intel.com:1080 %h %p  # Optional Proxy Command
Host myidc
Hostname idcbetabatch.eglb.intel.com
User uXXXXXX #← Request "scheduled access" at https://scheduler.cloud.intel.com/#/systems" to get your user identifier.
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_idc
ServerAliveInterval 60
ServerAliveCountMax 10
StrictHostKeyChecking no
UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
```

### For PowerShell Users

* Note you must install ncat, it is done by installing <a href="https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-7.92-setup.exe">nMap</a> and selecting the ncat option.

```bash
Host myidc
Hostname idcbetabatch.eglb.intel.com
User uXXXXXX #← Request "scheduled access" at https://scheduler.cloud.intel.com/#/systems" to get your user identifier.
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_idc
#ProxyCommand ncat --proxy YourProxy:XXXX --proxy-type socks5 %h %p  ## Uncomment if necessary
ServerAliveInterval 60
ServerAliveCountMax 10
StrictHostKeyChecking no 
UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
```

### SSH folder and file permissions<div id='ssh-permissions'>

Ensure that permissions are correct when on Linux or MacOS - these are the commands to force that:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/known_hosts*
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id*
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/*.pub
```

Once you are configured properly, from the terminal future connections are established by entering:

```bash
ssh myidc
```
You are allowed up to 4 connections to the IDC.  If you lose a connection and rejoin, you may want to look for other lost login processes and kill them off (look with ps -aux).

---  
## Head Node vs Compute Nodes<div id='head-node-vs-compute-node'/>

Upon initial connection to the IDC, you are connected to the head node.  This IDC utilizes <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html">SLURM</a> to manage job scheduling and resource management.   As a cluster workload manager, SLURM has three key functions. First, it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources (compute nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work (normally a parallel job) on the set of allocated nodes. Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work.

### Head Node

The `head` node is a login node and a method of authentication, no development work can occur on the `head node`.  There are `no accelerators` on the head node.  From the head node you can do file management, launch and manage SLURM jobs on the dedicated partition or launch an interactive job on one of the worker nodes. Your home directory is automatically mounted on the worker node when you connect.  It has a maximum of 20GB of storage.  There is a data directory where training, datasets, and conda-configs are stored.  `/home/common/data`

### Interactive Worker Nodes

The worker node is a standard Ubuntu 22.04.02 LTS environment including many developer utilities.  In addition <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html#gs.30y95h">the Intel oneAPI Basekit, HPCKit, Renderkit and several Intel optimized AI environments using Conda and OpenVino are installed.</a>  

#### Go interactive!

```bash
srun --pty bash
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
```

The `interactive worker nodes` are resource constrained in that they are shared resources, so please be courteous.  Running code on the interactive session is just like being on a local session and you can run code without submitting to a queue.  There is at least one PVC in each worker node.  For maximum performance submit your job to the `pvc partition` which will run your code using all resources available and if your code can make use of `Intel(R) Data Center GPU Max 1100's` there are 4 in each `non interactive node`.  Keep in mind this is a one at a time job, so you might have to wait awhile.

--- 
## Environment Setup<div id='environment-setup'/>  

Enter `source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh` and the oneAPI development environment will be initialized.

Enter `conda env list` and activate the python environment of your choice.  Both Tensorflow and Pytorch environments have Jupyter installed.  If you don't like those environments create your own conda environment and customize to your liking. 

---
## Verify it works / Troubleshoot<div id='troubleshoot'>

Please verify that your environment works at this point enough to "see" the PVC (GPUs).  If you cannot, there is little point in doing more until we fix it so you *can* see the GPUs.

Here are the commands you should have done already to reach a node with GPUs, plus three more.  The first command is on your system. The second command is on the head node. The last three commands will be on an a node that has PVC cards.  The output of these commands see if have access to the GPU cards, and if not give us a hint on why not.

```bash
ssh myidc
srun --pty bash
groups  # Key group is render, PVC access is unavailable if you do not have render group present.
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
sycl-ls
```

The output of *sycl-ls* should show multiple lines mentioning *Data Center GPU Max*.  If this is true, you have successfully confirmed that you have access to GPUs.  Proceed to additional steps - no further testing is needed.

If you do not see *Data Center GPU Max* in your *sycl-ls* output, then we need to figure out why so you can report the right issues to support.

First, check the output of the 'groups' command. The output is a list (on one line, no commas between the names) of groups your user ID is in.  One of those names needs to be **render**.  If it is not, stop at this point and send a note to support which mentions your actual user ID something like this: "My user *uxxxxxx* is not a member of group *render* - please correct this."  To submit this see [Where to get Support](#where-to-get-support).

Second, for a variety of reasons some nodes have a nasty habit of losing track of its PVC cards - we are investigating and improving things daily (this is a *beta* after all). If you issues with nodes where PVC cards disappear (to the OS), proven by *sycl-ls* not listing them, then please let us know (see [Where to get Support](#where-to-get-support)).  Also, feel free to try other nodes (from head node, use `srun -p pvc-shared -w idc-beta-batch-pvc-node-05 --pty bash` to force yourself onto node 05 (change to try other nodes). You can see what nodes are online with `sinfo -al` and once you are on a node you can see if the cards (Intel(R) Data Center GPU Max) are by running `sycl-ls` (after you source setvars of course).
 
## Jupyter<div id='jupyter'/>

This will get better, there are security issues that need to be overcome in future versions of IDC, for now these are the overview of steps to run `Jupyter-lab`:

1. Login to the head node.
2. Launch an interactive session
3. Find the IP of the interactive session.  
4. Activate a conda environment that has jupyter-lab
5. Launch jupyter-lab and take note of the port
6. From another terminal port forward to your localhost
7. Launch a browser and paste the long link from the other terminal tab
8. Have fun with Jupyter-lab!

The details, enter these from a terminal:

```bash
ssh myidc
srun --pty bash
conda activate pytorch_xpu
jupyter-lab --ip $(hostname -i)
```
Take note of the IP and the port that jupyter launches on, it will look something like this:

```bash
http://10.10.10.8:8888/lab?token=9d83e1d8a0eb3ffed84fa3428aae01e592cab170a4119130
``` 

Your port will likely be different so replace `8888` with what was provided to you.  From a `new terminal` enter:

```bash
ssh myidc -L 8888:10.10.10.X:8888
```

 Open your browser and enter `localhost:8888` or shift+click the link in the other terminal, or paste the token that was provided to you when you initialized the server as your password and use Jupyter lab as usual.

---   

## Additional Software<div id='additional-software'/>

It's possible to install additional software if regular user permissions are the only requirements.  For example to install <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/get-started-with-intel-distribution-for-python.html">the Intel® Distribution for Python</a> follow these steps:  Miniconda is already installed, but you will be creating a virtual environment in your home directory.  

1.  `conda activate base`
2.  `conda update conda`
3.  `conda config --add channels intel`
4.  `conda create -n idp intelpython3_core python=3.10`
5.  `conda activate idp`

Keep in mind you have 20GB of storage in your home directory for all software and data.

---  
## Common Slurm Commands<div id='common-commands'/>

```bash
sinfo -al (What Nodes are available)
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT   JOB_SIZE ROOT OVERSUBS     GROUPS  NODES       STATE NODELIST
pvc*         up    2:00:00          1   no       NO        all      3        idle idc-beta-batch-pvc-node-[01-03]

squeue -al (How many jobs are in the queue)
JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER    STATE       TIME TIME_LIMI  NODES NODELIST(REASON)

sbatch -p {PARTITION-NAME} {SCRIPT-NAME}
srun -p {PARTITION-NAME} {SCRIPT-NAME}
scancel {JOB-ID}

Go interactive with a compute node

srun --pty bash
```

---  
## Sample GPU Test Code<div id='sample-gpu-test-code'/>

Here is a sample GPU test code that demonstrates functionality and how to offload the application execution to a `compute node`.  Follow the below steps:

Step 1.  Copy the code below into a file.

```C++
#include <sycl/sycl.hpp>
using namespace sycl;
int main() {
//# Create a device queue with device selector
  queue q(gpu_selector_v);
//# Print the device name
  std::cout << "Device: " << q.get_device().get_info<info::device::name>() << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```
Step 2.  Save the file as `getdev.cpp`

Step 3.  Enter the following commands to compile and run the application.

```bash
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh

icpx -fsycl getdev.cpp

srun a.out
```

If successful it should return Device: Intel(R) Data Center GPU Max 1100.  Demonstrating that you successfully compiled a SYCL application and offloaded it's execution to a GPU on the compute node.

---  
## An Example Script<div id='some-example-scripts'/>

This will email you at the start and completion of your job.  

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=gpu_run
#SBATCH --partition=pvc-shared
#SBATCH --error=job.%J.err 
#SBATCH --output=job.%J.out
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
#SBATCH --mail-user=your@emai.com

srun ./my_a.out
```

---  
## Running MPI<div id='mpi'/>

When using MPI, you should set these environment variables (put in your ~/.bashrc to always have them):
```bash
export I_MPI_PORT_RANGE=50000:50500
export btl_tcp_port_min_v4=1024
unset SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE
unset SLURM_JOBID
```

Visit the [MPI with SYCL example page](etc/MPI.md) for a quick example of how to get a SYCL Hello World from 40 different connections to GPUs (40 ranks).

## If you use MobaXterm<div id="MobaXterm">

If you like using ModaXterm, here are notes from a user (thank you Yuning!) on the steps to make it fully work:

Step 1: Get ip address  

echo $(ip a | grep -v -e "127.0.0.1" -e "inet6" | grep "inet" | awk {'print($2)}' | sed 's/\/.*//') 

example output: 10.10.10.8 

Step2: Select the tunneling tab in MobaXterm

## VTune, Advisor, PTrace - and other things you will get later<div id='securitynogoes'>

VTune, Advisor, and PTrace will come later - not now.
We will not install or offer tools that give system wide insight, due to serious security concerns that exist when you have a very diverse community of users.
This means that VTune, Advisor, and PTrace will not be installed or activated.
We do plan to offer more isolated systems in the future which will host these highly useful tools.  We love them and it pains us to have to leave them off these systems.

---
## FAQs: Super Important Tips that may be non-obvious<div id='faq'>

Please read these carefully, many may solve obstacles you encounter.

1. **Incoming only ssh/fstp/scp:** Your ~/.ssh directory is owned by root.  Please leave it alone, changing it would not do what you hope.  You can use https in and out (e.g., git). However, ssh, sftp, scp, etc. are incoming only.  You can use the -L option on your ssh into the instance to connect your machine nicely into the instance.  If you cannot figure out how to get this working, or feel it is too limiting - reach out to us to [discuss via request support - see instructions.](#where-to-get-support)
2. **Do not forget /tmp:** Your account has (only) 20G of persistent storage (available on all nodes, and persists between logins). For more high speed temporary space, try using /tmp. Of course, /tmp may be wiped clean by a reboot - it should survive on a node otherwise. If you need to reconnect, you may need to specify the node you need to attach to using an additional option on srun such as -w idc-beta-batch-pvc-node-XX (you need to know which node XX to specify).  If there is popular dataset, or tool, you want available globally - reach out to us to [make suggestion via request support - see instructions.](#where-to-get-support)
3. **Do remember /tmp is NOT PERMANENT** all files in /tmp will disappear without notice (reboots) - so its a great place to use extra space for a brief time, but don't do work there that is not easily recreated
4. **Renew your access before it expires:** We cannot restore files if you let your access expire - they really are lost. We recommend you [Extend your access](#extend-access)) in the week preceeding expiration, and due to a bug (see next section) you really do not want to use it on the last day. Of course, even if it expires you can create another instance and recreate your environment/files.
5. **If your ssh fails** the two most common causes are: (a) incorrect ssh folder and file permissions, (b) being out of sync with the instance.  For the first (a), refer to [SSH folder and file permissions](#ssh-permissions). For the latter (b), go to https://scheduler.cloud.intel.com ([click here to see the screenshots on how to do](#put-key-in)) and put your public key in your profile (to be sure it matches the one you are using on your systme) and then launch a new instance.
6. **Publish results:** We welcome you publishing results you get from using Intel Developer Cloud. Of course, if you see anything unexpected we would welcome [questions via request support - see instructions.](#where-to-get-support). We enjoy seeing mention if you enjoyed using the Intel Developer Cloud, and we encourage you to use the exclusive queue to get performance numbers without others on the system you are running upon. The systems with PCIe cards are 1100 (single tile) GPUs, and we will eventually also have 1550 (dual tile) GPUs. Noting which model you used is encouraged too.
7. **GDB** gdb is called via gdb-oneapi. This version will enable you to debug on CPU and GPU.

## Notable Known Issues<div id='issues'>

We really need your feedback - so keep them coming ([to submit feedback see section below: Where to get Support](#where-to-get-support)).

Please read kindly: I note "we plan to fix before August" below... and I mean it.  "Plan" means it is subject to change - and "before August" currently means about July 28.

Right now, here are a few things we know are not working:
1.  **emacs** is on the head node, but missing on the other nodes (oops) - forcing the humiliation of using vim or nano for now (highest priority to fix in my book); we plan to fix before August
2.  **renew before your last day** (free to do so - see the section below: [Extend your access](#extend-access)) - because on your last day for an allocation you can still log in but things like SLURM will stop working
3.  **getpwuid()** is broken on nodes - you may see error messages or warnings like "username unknown" - mostly harmless, other than a few apps which will refuse to run; we plan to fix before August
4.  **many additional conda packages** would be nice to have preinstalled (we will add more); we plan to add before August
5.  **cannot use/see PVC** - please read [Troubleshooting](#troubleshoot) - we see several reasons pop up that users cannot access the GPU (PVC) - start with the [Verify it works / Troubleshoot](#troubleshoot) to see if it is a configuration issue, or something else - yes, some nodes have a nasty habit of losing track of its PVC cards - we are investigating - if you issues with nodes where PVC cards disappear (to the OS) - let us know, and feel free to try other nodes (from head node, use "srun -p pvc-shared -w idc-beta-batch-pvc-node-05 --pty bash" to force yourself onto node 05 (change to try other nodes). You can see what nodes are online with "sinfo -al" and once you are on a node you can see if the cards (Intel(R) Data Center GPU Max) are by running "sycl-ls" (after you source setvars of course).

Recently resolved:
1.  **/tmp** filesystem allows builds (executables) now - so you can use the space for TEMPORARY build (cleared at reboots)
2.  nodes no longer limited by head node ulimits (was a mistaken we fixed)
3.  **unzip** is on the systems now
4.  **HPC toolkit **is on the systems now (including Fortran)

## Extend your access<div id='extend-access'/>

This is subject to change - here is where we are now:
1. The system should auto-extend your account if you are using it during the last week of your allocated time. If it is idle in the days before it expires, your account will disappear and we cannot restore it (asking would be futile).
2. In the final week, you can visit https://scheduler.cloud.intel.com and request an extension.  Ideally, a button will appear next ot the instance when you schedule the "View Instances" tab. Click it and fill in the form and submit. If nothing appears on the "View Instances" tab - then you need to go to the "Launch Instance" tab, check the box in front of "Intel® Max Series GPU (PVC) on 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® processors - 1100 series (4x) (Batch Processing/Scheduled access)" and click "Launch Instance." You should now see a button to request an extension, click it and follow instructions to submit a request.  If all else fails, please [request support - see instructions.](#where-to-get-support)
